It has the form of a dialogue between the author (the {Teacher:}) and an inquisitive reader (the {Student:}). This is exceptionally convenient for analysing common errors made by students in entrance examinations, for reviewing different methods of solving the same problems and for discussing difficult questions of physical theory.
